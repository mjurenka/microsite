            I have been very interested in computers since I was very young. I was trying new things, messing around with Windows and then I discovered programming. My world has changed since then. Now I create web sites and web apps in languages like PHP and Python with help of SQL, I write project for school mainly in C# and Java and currently I'm working on optimizing genetic algorithm in C. I studied one year abroad during my study in highschool. I went to Spokane Valley, WA in USA to complete one year of study in americal highschool. That one year brought me counless amount of experience in both English language and meeting new interesting people in new environment.
